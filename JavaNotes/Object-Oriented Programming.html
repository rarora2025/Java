<p><em>Object Oriented Programming</em>- the technique of developing computer programs by using components called objects</p>
<p><em>an object (in OOP)</em>- a special kind of variable that contains both data attributes and methods that can manipulate that data</p>
<p><em>a class</em>- a collection of types and methods that work together</p>
<p>The purpose of OOP is to provide programmers with the class programming construct which enables them to implement objects. OOP languages such as Java also provide an extensive library of built-in classes to help programmers be more productive.</p>
<h3 id="constructors">Constructors</h3>
<p><em>Class constructors are special methods that are associated with classes.</em></p>
<p>Java has certain rules that class constructors must follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Constructors must have exactly the same name as the class.</li>
<li>Constructors must not have a return type.<br>
–If you have a method that has exactly the same name as the class, but has a specified return type, then Java will treat that method as a regular member method.</li>
<li>Constructors should be given public access. Actually, Java doesn’t require this, but we will follow this rule for everything that we do in this course.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How constructors are different from methods in Java?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Constructor(s) must have the same name as the class within which it defined while it is not necessary for the method in java.</li>
<li>Constructor(s) do not return any type while method(s) have the return type or  void  if does not return any value.</li>
<li>Constructor is called only once at the time of Object creation while method(s) can be called any numbers of time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method Overloading</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>creating multiple methods with different arguments- in both number and type (a.k.a signature) for more flexibility</li>
</ul>
<p><em>method overloading is most commonly used with constructors</em></p>
<p><strong>Default Constructors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a constructor that has no parameters/arguments</li>
<li>If we have defined any parameterized constructor, then compiler will not create default constructor. and vice versa If you don’t provide a class constructor, Java will automatically provide something called a default constructor.</li>
<li>Java’s default constructor will initialize class members with numeric types to zero, and class members of type char to null. It will not initialize non-primitive types, but will call their constructors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Delegating or Chaining Constructors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Constructor-Chaining-In-Java1.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p><strong>Rules of constructor chaining/delegation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>There should be at-least be one constructor without the this() keyword (constructor 3 in above example).</li>
<li>Constructor chaining can be achieved in any order.</li>
<li>The  <strong>this()</strong>  expression (constructor calling) should always be the first line of the constructor. For example, following fragment is invalid and throws compile time error.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Box(int num)
{
    boxNo = num;

    /* Constructor call must be the first
       statement in a constructor */
    this();  /*ERROR*/
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="class-static-vs-instance-vs-local-variables">Class (<code>Static</code>) vs Instance vs Local Variables</h3>
<p><strong>Instance Variables</strong>: Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor or block.</p>
<ul>
<li>Variables associated with each object, or instance, from a class</li>
<li>Instance Variables can be accessed only by creating objects:  they are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.</li>
<li>Each object has its own "customizable` copy of the class’s instance variables</li>
<li>Initialization of Instance Variable is not Mandatory. Its default value is 0</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class Variables</strong>: Class variables are also known as Static variables, and they use the <code>static</code> keyword</p>
<ul>
<li>These variables are declared similarly as instance variables, the difference is that static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside any method constructor or block.</li>
<li>Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per class irrespective of how many objects we create. This copy is associated with the entire class, rather than each object.</li>
<li>Static variables are created at the start of program execution and destroyed automatically when execution ends.</li>
<li>Initialization of Static Variable is not Mandatory. Its default value is 0</li>
<li>If we access the static variable like Instance variable (through an object), the compiler will show the warning message and it won’t halt the program. The compiler will replace the object name to class name automatically.</li>
<li>If we access the static variable without the class name, Compiler will automatically append the class name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods have basically the same difference- <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-methods-vs-instance-methods-java/">visit here for reference</a></p>
<h4 id="static--methods-cannot-directly-access-instance-variables-and-instance-methods">static  Methods Cannot Directly Access Instance Variables and Instance Methods</h4>
<p>A  <code>static</code>  method  <em>cannot</em>  access a class’s instance variables and instance methods, because a  <code>static</code>  method can be called even when no objects of the class have been instantiated. For the same reason, the  <code>this</code>  reference  <em>cannot</em>  be used in a  <code>static</code>method. The  <code>this</code>  reference must refer to a specific object of the class, and when a  <code>static</code>  method is called, there might not be any objects of its class in memory.</p>
<p><strong>Local Variables</strong>: A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called local variable.</p>
<ul>
<li>These variable are created when the block in entered or the function is called and destroyed after exiting from the block or when the call returns from the function.</li>
<li>The scope of these variables exists only within the block in which the variable is declared. i.e. we can access these variable only within that block.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>’This’ Reference Keyword:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>like <code>self</code> in python</li>
<li>the way to access a reference of the current object</li>
</ul>
<p>The most common use of the  <code>this</code>  keyword is to eliminate the confusion between instance variables and parameters with the same name (because a class attribute is shadowed by a method or constructor parameter).</p>
<p><code>this</code>  can also be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invoke current class constructor</li>
<li>Invoke current class method</li>
<li>Return the current class object</li>
<li>Pass an argument in the method call</li>
<li>Pass an argument in the constructor call</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="encapsulation-in-java-getters-and-setters">Encapsulation in Java (Getters and Setters)</h3>
<p>Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.</p>
<ul>
<li>Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared.</li>
<li>As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes using the data hiding concept which is achieved by making the members or methods of class as private and the class is exposed to the end user or the world without providing any details behind implementation using the abstraction concept, so it is also known as  <strong>combination of data-hiding and abstraction.</strong>.</li>
<li>Encapsulating class members means that some data an methods will not be accessible to programmers who use the class in their programs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to achieve Encapsulation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Declare all the variables in the class as private and write public methods (setters/getters) in the class to set and get the values of variables.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Declare all variables in class as private<br>
<code>private int geekRoll;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each private variable, create a set method that sets the variable:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>public setName(String name){
this.name = name;
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>This method will replace a constructor.</em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Create a get method that gets the variable</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>public String getName(){
return name;
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>This method will replace being able to directly access the attribute, using object.variableName</em></p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/65494511/timeline"></a></p>
<p><strong>Nicknames for Set and Get Methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set methods are also commonly called <strong>mutator methods</strong> because they typically change an objects state/modify the values on instance variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get methods are also commonly called <strong>accessor methods</strong> or <strong>query methods</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The difference between a  <em>variable, field, attribute, and property</em>  in Java</strong>:</p>
<p><em>A variable</em>  is the name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.</p>
<p><em>A field</em>  is a data member of a class. Unless specified otherwise, a field can be public, static, not static and final.</p>
<p><em>An attribute</em>  is another term for a field. It’s typically a public field that can be accessed directly (normally not static, because it is an instance variable).</p>
<p>Unless it specifically mentions that it is static, always assume that fields and attributes refer to instance variables<br>
–Even Class attributes refers to instance variables</p>
<ul>
<li>In NetBeans or Eclipse, when we type object of a class and after that dot(.) they give some suggestion which are called Attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A property</em>  is a term used for fields, but it typically has getter and setter combination.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of Encapsulation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Hiding:  The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class. It will not be visible to the user that how the class is storing values in the variables. He only knows that we are passing the values to a setter method and variables are getting initialized with that value.</li>
<li>Increased Flexibility:  We can make the variables of the class as read-only or write-only depending on our requirement. If we wish to make the variables as read-only then we have to omit the setter methods like setName(), setAge() etc. from the above program or if we wish to make the variables as write-only then we have to omit the get methods like getName(), getAge() etc. from the above program</li>
<li>Reusability: Encapsulation also improves the re-usability and easy to change with new requirements.</li>
<li>Testing code is easy:  Encapsulated code is easy to test for unit testing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h3>
<p>Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user. The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.</p>
<p>Data  abstraction  is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.</p>
<p>Abstraction can be achieved with either  <strong>abstract classes</strong>  or  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_interface.asp"><strong>interfaces</strong></a>  (which you will learn more about in the next chapter).</p>
<p>The  <code>abstract</code>  keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Abstract class:</strong>  is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abstract method:</strong>  can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods:</p>
<pre class=" language-java"><code class="prism  language-java"><span class="token keyword">abstract</span> <span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">Animal</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">abstract</span> <span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">animalSound</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">sleep</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    System<span class="token punctuation">.</span>out<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">println</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Zzz"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

</code></pre>
<p>From the example above, it is not possible to create an object of the Animal class:</p>
<pre class=" language-java"><code class="prism  language-java">Animal myObj <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">Animal</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token comment">// will generate an error</span>

</code></pre>
<p>To access the abstract class, it must be inherited from another class. Like for example, in this case you can make a pig class that inherits animal class and can utilize its methods. Now, you would be able to create pig objects.</p>
<h4 id="why-and-when-to-use-abstract-classes-and-methods">Why And When To Use Abstract Classes and Methods?</h4>
<p>To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  Abstraction can also be achieved with  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_interface.asp">Interfaces</a>, which you will learn more about in the next chapter.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://contribute.geeksforgeeks.org/encapsulation-in-java/">Encapsulation</a>  is data hiding(information hiding) while Abstraction is detail hiding(implementation hiding).</li>
<li>While encapsulation groups together data and methods that act upon the data, data abstraction deals with exposing the interface to the user and hiding the details of implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages of Abstraction</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It reduces the complexity of viewing the things.</li>
<li>Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.</li>
<li>Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.</li>
