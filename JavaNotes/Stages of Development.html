<p><strong>Alpha</strong>- earliest release of a software product that’s still under active development</p>
<p><strong>Beta</strong>- released to larger number of developers later in the development process after most major bugs have been fixed and new features are almost complete</p>
<p><strong>Release Candidates</strong>- generally feature complete, bug free, and ready for use by the community</p>
<p><strong>Final release</strong>- All bugs from release candidate are corrected and the final product is released to the general public</p>
<p><strong>Continuous beta</strong>- Software that’s developed using this approach generally does not have version numbers. It is hosted in the cloud (servers over internet) and is constantly evolving so that users always have the latest version</p>
