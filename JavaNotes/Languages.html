<p><em><strong>Machine Languages</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>generally consists of strings of numbers that instruct computers to perform their most elementary operations one at a time</li>
<li>these are machine dependent</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Assembly Languages</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>languages that programmers understand that are translated to machine languages so that the computer can read them</li>
<li>much more clear to humans, but are incomprehensible to computers until translated</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assemblers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>translator programs developed to translate from Assembly Languages to Machine Languages</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>High-Level Languages</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Even more comprehensible to programmers, and a lot more efficient</li>
<li>Also translated to Machine Language for the computer to read (using Compilers)</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Compilers</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>programs that convert high-level language programs into machine language very fast</li>
</ul>
