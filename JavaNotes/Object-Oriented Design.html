<p>What is most important for our purposes is to understand the basic principles and reasoning behind this layered approach.</p>
<p><strong>The Application/Domain Layer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Classes that make up the problem solution parts of our design live in this layer. So, classes like the Date class we have been discussing would live in this layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Presentation Layer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>User interface classes…classes that interact with the end users of a program and give a program its look and feel…live in their own layer, which is called a presentation layer in this diagram. The key idea here is that the user interface functionality is separated from the application functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>So…we can have many user interface classes for a program without having to adapt the application classes to each different user interface.<br>
For example, we might have classes in the presentation layer that provide a graphical user interface…or GUI…functionality that includes things like windows, buttons, and drop-down menus. Or…we could have a class that simply consists of a main() method that performs very basic prompts.</p>
<p>—We can represent the relationship between these two (identify) by drawing a line from all of the Application Layers to all of the presentation layers and then writing “uses” on the line to specify that the presentation layer uses the domain layer.</p>
<p><em>In an object-oriented design that deals with manipulating information about full-time and part-time employees in a corporation, in what part of the design would a PartTimeEmployee class and a FullTimeEmployee class reside?</em></p>
<p>The correct answer is the domain or application layer.</p>
